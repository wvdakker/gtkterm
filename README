Command line options
  --help or -h : this help screen
  --config <configuration> or -c : load configuration
  --port <device> or -p : serial port device (default /dev/ttyS0)
  --speed <speed> or -s : serial port speed (default 9600)
  --bits <bits> or -b : number of bits (default 8)
  --stopbits <stopbits> or -t : number of stopbits (default 1)
  --parity <odd | even> or -a : parity (default none)
  --flow <Xon | CTS> or -w : flow control (default none)
  --delay <ms> or -d : end of line delay in ms (default none)
  --char <char> or -r : wait for a special char at end of line (default none)
  --file <filename> or -f : default file to send (default none)
  --echo or -e : switch on local echo


NOTES on RS485:
     The RS485 flow control is a software user-space emulation and therefore
may not work for all configurations (won't respond quickly enough).  If this is
the case for your setup, you will need to either use a dedicated RS232 to 
RS485 converter, or look for a kernel level driver.  This is an inherent 
limitation to user space programs.


Building:
 GtkTerm has a few dependencies-
* Gtk+2.0 (version 2.6 or higher)
* vte (version 0.20 or higher)
* intltool (version 0.40.0 or higher)

 Once these dependencies are installed, most people should simply run:
  ./configure
  make

 And to install:
  make install

 See INSTALL for more detailed build and install options.
